using an ESP32-S3-WROOM-1, 
and adafruit clone 14-segment LED HT16K33 backpacks

Making a toy to ping an address over wifi, and show the time to travel.

Started December 2024

TODO:

Write a function to display strings on the LEDs
Write an animation function to display when fetching, when ping is high, and so forth

Need to add a switch to enable the settings webpage even when connected to WiFi.

Need to wire up 3rd (or 4th?) LED display to really show data

FUTURE:

add in HTTP fetcher to get and search for strings on public web pages
